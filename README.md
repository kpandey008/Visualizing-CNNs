# Visualizing Convolutional Neural Nets

This project aims to study the kind of representations learned by ConvNets at different layers. The implementations in this project are based on the ideas presented in the papers:

1) Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps by Simonyan et.al.

2) Understanding deep image representations by inverting them by Mahendran et.al.
